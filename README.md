This project explores the development of an Augmented Reality (AR) home decoration experience using the Meta Quest 3 headset. Leveraging the passthrough feature, users can seamlessly interact with their real-world environment while virtually placing and arranging furniture. Built in Unity 2022.3.62f2 with the XR Interaction Toolkit, the application features a lightweight and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to summon, manipulate, and remove furniture objects from a curated pool of predetermined objects. The system aims to simulate real-world decorating, allowing users to visualize design choices within their own space using technology that forgoes stressful or difficult movement. The aim is to allow people with disabilities, physical restrictions, or other challenges relating to moving heavy objects a chance to envision their home the way they choose. Overall the project demonstrates the potential of AR in enhancing user accessibility and providing interactive, practical tools for interior design.
